# Clock Generator
This is a simple clock generator for Eurorack modular, or any system that accepts a clock/trigger.

It is based around an Arduino Nano with an optional OLED display, which shows the BPM.

## Bill of materials:
- Arduino Nano ATMEGA328
- SSD1306 0.91" OLED
- Rotary encoder
- 3.5mm audio jack (x5 if you want to output mults/divs)

## TODO
- [ ] Get display working
- [ ] Get rotary encoder working
- [ ] Output 1:1 clock
- [ ] Output 4:1, 2:1, 1:2, and 1:4 clocks
